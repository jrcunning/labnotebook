DNA from samples of corals, sediments, and water collected in St. John during summer 2015 was extracted by intern George Davies using the CTAB-chloroform protocol. From preliminary PCRs, ITS2 was not successfully amplified from sediment samples. Here, I will perform a final verification that sediment samples fail to amplify ITS2, and that all negative extraction controls (i.e., blank DNA extractions) also do not amplify ITS2 (i.e., extractions are not contaminated).

# PCR Setup
| Reagent | Each rxn (µL) | MasterMix (µL) |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| H2O | 18.9 | 699.3 |
| 10x buffer | 2.5 | 92.5 |
| MgCl2 @ 50 mM | 1.0 | 37.0 |
| dNTPs | 0.25 | 9.25 |
| F primer (itsDtag95 @ 10 µM) | 0.5 | 18.5 |
| R primer (its2rev2-bio @ 10 µM) | 0.5 | 18.5 |
| Taq | 0.1 | 3.7 |
| BSA 100x | 0.25 | 9.25 |

# Thermocycling
3min@95°C, 35x(30s@95°C, 30s@55°C, 30s@72°C), 10min@72°C

# Results

## Conclusion: PCR was successful and negative extraction controls are clean

## Conclusion: PCR was successful and sediment samples are remaining negative extraction controls do not amplify. 

# Next steps:
Moving forward with library preps for coral and water samples, which are verified free of contamination by clean blank extractions. Sediment samples will not be included in library preps and sequencing because they fail to amplify.
