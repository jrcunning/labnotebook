### Restriction enzyme digest
Digest DNA with restriction enzyme _DpnII_, which cleaves at GATC cut sites. All DNA from the three sample pools will be digested in 50 µL reactions.

#### Reaction setup:

| reagent | volume per reaction (µL) | Mastermix for 3 reactions (µL) |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
|  DNA    | 25 | -- |
| Buffer  | 5 | 15.5 |
| H<sub>2</sub>O | 19 | 58.9 |
| _DpnII_ | 1 | 3.1 |
| **Total:** | **50** | 77.5 |

Add 25 µL of Mastermix to each tube of pooled DNA (each containing 25 µL DNA, see prev. entry)
  
  
  
  
  
#### Digest:

Set thermocycler for:

* 3 hours at 37°C
* 20 min. at 65°C
* Hold at 15°C
