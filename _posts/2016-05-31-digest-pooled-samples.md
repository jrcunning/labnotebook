### Restriction enzyme digest
Digest DNA with restriction enzyme _DpnII_, which cleaves at GATC cut sites. All DNA from the three sample pools will be digested in 50 µL reactions.

#### Reaction setup:

| reagent | volume per reaction (µL) | Mastermix for 3 reactions (µL) |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
|  DNA    | 25 | -- |
| Buffer  | 5 | 15.5 |
| H<sub>2</sub>O | 19 | 58.9 |
| _DpnII_ | 1 | 3.1 |
| **Total:** | **50** | 77.5 |

Add 25 µL of Mastermix to each tube of pooled DNA (each containing 25 µL DNA, see prev. entry)
  
  
  
  
  
#### Digest:

Set thermocycler for:

* 3 hours at 37°C
* 20 min. at 65°C
* Hold at 15°C

(Frozen overnight - bead clean and gel to run tomorrow)

##### June 1, 2016

#### Post-digest bead clean:

1. Add 90 µL Ampure XP beads to 50 µL digested DNA (1.8:1 vol. beads:DNA)
2. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.
3. Place on magnetic stand for 5 min.
4. Remove supernatant into waste container, leaving ~5 µL behing
5. Add 200 µL freshly made 80% ethanol (on magnetic stand)
6. Incubate 30 sec. then remove supernatant to waste container
7. Add 200 µL feshly made 80% ethanol (on magnetic stand)
8. Incubate 30 sec. then remove supernatant to waste container
9. Remove any residual ethanol using pipet
10. Let dry for 5 min., not longer than 10 min.
11. Resuspend beads in 30 µL H<sub>2</sub>O, pipet up and down
12. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.
13. Place on magnetic stand for 5 min.
14. Transfer 28 µL supernatant to destination tube

#### Gel of digested, bead-cleaned DNA:

1% agarose gel run @ 100V for 40 min.
3 µL each sample + 1 µL loading dye; 3 µL HyperLadder 50bp.

* BC = Bleached clade C pooled samples
* NC = Not-bleached clade C pooled samples
* ND = Not-bleached clade D pooled samples

![Gel 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20160601_gel1.tif)

Result: smear of DNA is visible in all three pooled samples between ~200-1000bp. Digest appears to have been successful.
