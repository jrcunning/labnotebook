title: "Sampling *Montipora flabellata* symbionts"

Not a whole lot of work has been done on *Montipora flabellata* in Kaneohe Bay, which is much less abundant than *Montipora capitata*. Nevertheless, *M. capitata* hosts symbionts from at least two clades of *Symbiodinium*, and so it is possible that *M. flabellata* also has flexible symbioses. To get an initial idea of what *Symbiodinium* clades are present in *M. flabellata*, I am collecting some small tissue samples from fragments that are now bleached, some that did not bleach, and some that bleached and recovered, and are being maintained in experimental tanks at the Point Lab. I will extract DNA and run qPCR assays to determine the relative abundance of clade C and/or D in these samples.


Samples collected:

SampleID | Colony ID | Origin | Status | Note
:------: | :-------: | :----: | :----: | :--:
660 | P | | bleached |
661 | P | | bleached |
662 | P | | bleached |
663 | A | HIMB | recovered | tip
664 | A | HIMB | recovered | edge
665 | A | HIMB | recovered | dark edge
666 | 1 | | did not bleach |
667 | 1 | | did not bleach | 
668 | 1 | | did not bleach |
669 | 2 | | did not bleach | 364 edge
670 | 2 | | did not bleach | 359 edge - unhealthy
671 | 2 | | did not bleach | 355 tip


Small tissue samples were collected in 1% SDS in DNAB, and immediately incubated at 65Â°C for 1.5 hrs.
