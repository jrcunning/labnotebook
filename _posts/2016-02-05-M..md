Finally got around to running the *Montipora flabellata* samples that I took from Angela's colonies back in November. I was expecting clade C *Symbiodinium* in all samples as the only prior knowledge of symbiont types in this species was ITS2-type C32/C32a (LaJeunesse et al. 2004, LaJeunesse and Thornhill 2013). Nevertheless, using clade C- and D-specific qPCR assays (Cunning and Baker 2013) we found that three out of four colonies (including one that had recovered from bleaching and two that had not bleached) contained clade D symbionts and no clade C. The fourth colony, which was bleached when sampled, contained trace levels of clade C and no clade D. This is the first report of clade D *Symbiodinium* in this species, and preliminary patterns indicate there is potential for symbiont shuffling following bleaching.
