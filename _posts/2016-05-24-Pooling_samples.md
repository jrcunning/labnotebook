 I will be pooling individuals within each group (Bleached-C, Notbleached-C, Notbleached-D) to create three libraries for sequencing. To pool samples, equal concentrations of DNA from each individual should be achieved with a total of 1.3 Âµg DNA to proceed to the digest.
 
 **Bleached-C:** 14 samples
 1300 ng / 14 samples = 92.85 ng/sample
25, 39, 53, 125, 131, 51, 57, 65, 79, 127, 137, 71, 77, 119
