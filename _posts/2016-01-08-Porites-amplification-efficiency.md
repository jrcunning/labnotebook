title: Porites DNA amplification efficiency

Genomic DNA extracted from *Porites* corals often contains PCR inhibitors, which precludes reliable quantification using qPCR. We are testing ways of cleaning up this DNA so it is suitable for assaying symbiont to host cell ratios with qPCR. Raphael has cleaned 8 *Porites* DNA samples using Ampure beads, which I am using to create dilution series to run standard curves to calculate amplification efficiency. If amplification efficiency is near 100%, then Ampure beads produce sufficiently clean DNA samples for qPCR.

**Samples**: 27, 28, 35, 36, 41, 42, 49, 50
**Primers**: PL1556PET, PL1556r (microsatellite primers from Concepcion et al. 2010, amplifying a 164bp fragment, melting temp. ~ 59°C). Obtained primer stocks from Zac Forsman, diluted aliquot to 10 µM in water.
**Each reaction**: 6.25 µL SYBR Green MasterMix, 0.5 µL forward primer @ 10 µM, 0.5 µL reverse primer @ 10 µM, 4.25 µL water, 1 µL DNA template
**Template**: Tenfold dilution series of each sample, five levels
