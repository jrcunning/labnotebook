title:  Pooling samples for ezRAD libraries
date: `r Sys.time()`
---

I will pool individual samples from each of the three groups (Bleached clade C, Not bleached clade C, Not bleached clade D) for ezRAD library preparation. 

Each group has 14 samples, and the library should have a total of 1300ng DNA. Therefore, we need `r 1300/14` ng of each sample. Using the DNA concentrations from the AccuClear assay, calculate the volume of `r 1300/14` ng for each sample:

```{r}
samples <- read.csv("samples.csv")
dnaconc <- read.csv("dnaconc.csv")
data <- merge(samples, dnaconc, by="colony")
data$needvol <- (1300/14) / data$ng.uL
data <- with(data, data[order(group, sample.date, colony), ])
knitr::kable(data, row.names=F)
```
